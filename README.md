# servidorJava
This program can be used as a server to upload/download files. It has proved to be useful in local networks, you will never need an USB to share files again. Also it has a nice graphic interface. Try it, it's free.

To use this code, download it, paste it on your preferred IDE (Netbeans in my case) and change "background.jpg" in line XXX for a path of your own image.
